* PythonDir
** Directory structure
There are three general directories in PythonDir: One for output, one
for the Python-scripts and one for the Python module mypackage.
*** output
Directory for output of all kind.
*** scripts
IPython scripts.
*** site-packages/mypackage
Module with functions ready for use in IPython scripts. For the module
to be loaded by Python, the path has to be added to PYTHONPATH:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/PythonDir/site-packages
#+END_SRC
