#+TITLE: PythonDir
#+AUTHOR: Johannes Keller

=PythonDir= is my python environment for post-processing of
=SHEMAT-Suite= ([[*Rath, 2006][Rath, 2006]]) output, including 2D-figures of variables
and parameters, and, most notably, the evaluation and visualization of
RMSE distributions from a number of Ensemble Kalman Filter synthetic
experiments.

* Directory structure
There are three general directories in PythonDir: One for output, one
for the Python-scripts and one for the Python module mypackage.
** =/output=
Directory for output of all kind.
** =/scripts=
IPython scripts.
** =/site-packages/mypackage=
Module with functions ready for use in IPython scripts. For the module
to be loaded by Python, the path has to be added to PYTHONPATH:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/PythonDir/site-packages
#+END_SRC
