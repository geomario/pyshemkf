PythonDir
---------

There are four general directories in PythonDir: One for input, one
for output, one for the Python-scripts and one for the Python module
mypackage.
* input
Input from other programs (usually txt or vtk). This directory is
empty, can be filled with input for python scripts.
* output
Directory for output of all kind.
* scripts
IPython scripts.
* site-packages/mypackage

to be loaded by Python, the path has to be added to PYTHONPATH:
- export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/PythonDir/site-packages
